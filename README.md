# verlet_physics
A simple physics simulator using verlet integration.

To build the program into an executable, you need to first install SFML.
Next, you will need to navigate to the makefile, and replace all instances of
"-I/usr/local/SFML/include" and "-L/usr/local/SFML/lib" with the path to your specific SFML
installation. Then you can execute "make e" to build the program, and then "make r" to run it.
